            <dt><strong> Gentle Hatha Yoga </strong></dt>
            <dd> Intended for beginners and anyone wishing a grounded foundation in the practice of yoga, this 60 minute
                class of poses and slow movement focuses on asana (proper alignment and posture), pranayama (breath
                work), and guided meditation to foster your mind and body connection.
            </dd>
            <dt><strong> Vinyasa Yoga </strong></dt>
            <dd> Although designed for intermediate to advanced students, beginners are welcome to sample this 60 minute
                class that focuses on breath-synchronized movement - you will inhale and exhale as you flow
                energetically through yoga poses.
            </dd>
            <dt><strong> Restorative Yoga </strong></dt>

                This calming, restorative experience is suitable for students of any level of experience. This practice
                can be a perfect way to help rehabilitate an injury.

        <h2>Relax Anytime with Savasana</h2>
        <p>Prepare yourself for savasana. Lie down on your yoga mat with your arms at your side with palms up. Close
            your eyes and breathe slowly but deeply. Sink into the mat and let your worries slip away. When you are
            ready, roll on your side and use your arms to push yourself up to a sitting position with crossed legs.
            Place your hands in a prayer position. Be grateful for all that you have in life. Namaste.</p>
